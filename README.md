# Options Pricing Interactive Analysis

This project provides an interactive tool for exploring options pricing using the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulations. You can adjust model parameters and visualize the impact on price, vega, theta, and delta. The tool also demonstrates delta hedging and allows for numerical calculation of greeks under non-normal return distributions.

## Features
- Interactive Black-Scholes calculator with adjustable parameters
- Visualization of price, vega, theta, and delta
- Delta hedging demonstration
- Monte Carlo simulation for greeks with non-normal returns

## Getting Started
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
3. Install dependencies (see below).
4. Open the Jupyter notebook and start exploring.

## Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib plotly ipywidgets jupyter
```

## Usage
- Launch Jupyter Lab or Notebook in VS Code.
- Open the provided notebook and use the interactive widgets to explore options pricing and greeks.

## Project Structure
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: Copilot customization
